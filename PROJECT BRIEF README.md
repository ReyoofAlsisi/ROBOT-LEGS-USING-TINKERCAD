# ROBOT-LEGS-USING-TINKERCAD
I have developed a robotic leg designed to simulate human leg movements with precision. This robotic leg integrates servo motors at critical joints—ankles, knees, and hips—allowing for realistic motion and adaptability. The design accommodates standard-sized servo motors to ensure efficient operation and ease of integration.

The dimensions of the robotic leg are: 
the thigh length is 300 mm, the lower leg is 250 mm, and the foot is 150 mm in length. This configuration ensures that the servo motors used are appropriately sized to handle the mechanical loads and provide accurate movement. The system is engineered for both strength and flexibility, making it suitable for various applications in robotics and automation.
